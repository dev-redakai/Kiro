# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical validation errors in the ETL pipeline that are causing pipeline failures during the data cleaning stage. The errors include date validation issues with categorical data and missing error handler parameters, which prevent successful data processing and analytical table generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want the ETL pipeline date validation to handle categorical data properly, so that the pipeline doesn't fail when processing date fields that may contain categorical values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the date validation encounters categorical data THEN the system SHALL convert or handle it gracefully without throwing comparison errors
2. WHEN date validation fails due to data type issues THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings and continue processing
3. WHEN date fields contain mixed data types THEN the validation SHALL handle each type appropriately
4. WHEN date conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages with context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want error handler calls to include all required parameters, so that error handling works correctly and doesn't cause secondary failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the error handler SHALL be called with the correct category parameter
2. WHEN error handler is invoked THEN it SHALL receive all required arguments including ErrorCategory
3. WHEN error handling fails THEN the system SHALL not crash but log the handling failure
4. WHEN multiple validation errors occur THEN each SHALL be handled with appropriate categorization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want robust error handling in the validation system, so that individual validation failures don't cause the entire pipeline to fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a single validation rule fails THEN other validation rules SHALL continue to execute
2. WHEN validation encounters unexpected data types THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully
3. WHEN validation rules throw exceptions THEN the system SHALL catch and log them appropriately
4. WHEN validation completes THEN it SHALL provide a comprehensive summary of all results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want improved logging and error reporting for validation issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve data quality problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
2. WHEN date validation fails THEN the log SHALL include the problematic values and expected format
3. WHEN error handler calls fail THEN the system SHALL log the specific missing parameters
4. WHEN validation completes THEN it SHALL provide metrics on success/failure rates per rule
