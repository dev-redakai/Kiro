# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a scalable data engineering pipeline to process, clean, transform, and analyze a large e-commerce sales dataset. The system will handle millions of records from a mid-size e-commerce company selling electronics, fashion, and home goods across India and Southeast Asia, providing business insights through data transformations and an interactive dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to ingest large CSV files containing ~100 million e-commerce records efficiently without using distributed processing frameworks, so that I can process the data within memory constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing CSV files with ~100 million rows THEN the system SHALL use chunked reading to manage memory efficiently
2. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL NOT use Spark, Dask, Ray, or other distributed frameworks
3. WHEN ingesting data THEN the system SHALL handle memory-efficient data structures to prevent out-of-memory errors
4. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL provide progress tracking and logging
5. WHEN encountering file reading errors THEN the system SHALL handle exceptions gracefully and continue processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to automatically clean and standardize dirty e-commerce data, so that I can work with consistent and reliable datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing order_id fields THEN the system SHALL identify and handle duplicate order IDs
2. WHEN processing product_name fields THEN the system SHALL clean dirty/uncleaned product names and handle variations
3. WHEN processing category fields THEN the system SHALL standardize non-standard categories and handle variations
4. WHEN processing quantity fields THEN the system SHALL convert string quantities to numeric values and handle invalid entries (0, negative, non-numeric)
5. WHEN processing discount_percent fields THEN the system SHALL validate discount values are between 0.0 and 1.0 and flag errors for values >1
6. WHEN processing region fields THEN the system SHALL standardize region names (e.g., "North", "nort" â†’ "North")
7. WHEN processing sale_date fields THEN the system SHALL parse various date formats and handle null values
8. WHEN processing customer_email fields THEN the system SHALL validate email formats and handle null values
9. WHEN processing unit_price fields THEN the system SHALL validate numeric values and handle negative or zero prices
10. WHEN cleaning data THEN the system SHALL compute derived revenue field as quantity * unit_price * (1 - discount_percent)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want the system to generate analytical tables with key business metrics, so that I can understand sales performance across different dimensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating monthly_sales_summary THEN the system SHALL provide revenue, quantity, and average discount by month
2. WHEN generating top_products THEN the system SHALL identify top 10 products by revenue and units sold
3. WHEN generating region_wise_performance THEN the system SHALL calculate sales metrics by region
4. WHEN generating category_discount_map THEN the system SHALL compute average discount by product category
5. WHEN generating anomaly_records THEN the system SHALL identify top 5 records with extremely high revenue
6. WHEN creating analytical tables THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency and accuracy
7. WHEN processing transformations THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases like division by zero and null values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want an interactive dashboard to visualize key business metrics and trends, so that I can make data-driven decisions about sales performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display monthly revenue trends in a line chart
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show top 10 products in a bar chart or table
3. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL present sales by region in a geographic or bar visualization
4. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL highlight anomaly records in a dedicated section
5. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show category discount effectiveness in a heatmap
6. WHEN using the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide interactive filtering and drill-down capabilities
7. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL load and display data within reasonable response times
8. WHEN viewing visualizations THEN the system SHALL ensure charts are responsive and mobile-friendly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the data processing pipeline, so that I can ensure the correctness and reliability of transformations and cleaning logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL include at least 5 unit tests for transformation functions
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL include at least 5 unit tests for data cleaning logic
3. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL validate handling of null values, empty strings, and invalid data types
4. WHEN testing transformations THEN the system SHALL verify mathematical calculations are correct
5. WHEN testing data cleaning THEN the system SHALL ensure standardization rules are applied consistently
6. WHEN running the test suite THEN all tests SHALL pass and provide clear feedback on failures
7. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL validate memory usage and processing time within acceptable limits

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the pipeline to be well-documented and easily deployable, so that I can maintain and operate the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation for all major functions and classes
3. WHEN running the pipeline THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging of processing steps and errors
4. WHEN outputting results THEN the system SHALL save transformed data in both CSV and Parquet formats
5. WHEN packaging the system THEN the system SHALL include all source code, tests, and configuration files
6. WHEN setting up the environment THEN the system SHALL include requirements.txt with all dependencies
7. WHEN generating sample data THEN the system SHALL optionally include scripts to create test datasets

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want the system to detect and handle anomalous transactions, so that I can identify potential data quality issues or fraudulent activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing transactions THEN the system SHALL identify records with unusually high revenue values
2. WHEN detecting anomalies THEN the system SHALL flag transactions with suspicious patterns (e.g., extremely high quantities, unusual discount combinations)
3. WHEN processing anomalies THEN the system SHALL calculate statistical thresholds for anomaly detection
4. WHEN reporting anomalies THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about why records were flagged
5. WHEN handling anomalies THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of detection sensitivity parameters
